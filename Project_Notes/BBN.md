# Bayesian Belief Networks

## General Research on google notes

* Probablistic models define relationship between the variables and are used to calculate probabilites
* Regression, Naive Bayes and models like that assume conditional indepence of random variables
* Alternative is model that preserves known conditional dependence between random variables and conditional independence in other cases


* Bayesian networks are a probablilistic model that explicitly capture the known conditional dependence with directed edges in a graphical model
* All missing edges represent conditional independence
* BBN provides useful tool to visualize probablistic model for a domain
* Model can be prepared by experts or learned from data, then can be used for inference to estimate the probablilties for casual or subsequent events.
* BBN provides a intermediate approach for some conditionaly dependent and conditionaly independent variables
